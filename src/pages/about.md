[Paste Image to Download](/) is a utility website made by [Alejandro Akbal](https://akbal.dev)
for downloading images in your clipboard.

This tool was made for those moments where you take a screenshot and it is directly copied to the clipboard. \
Instead of going to MS Paint, pasting the image, choosing a location and saving it... **You can just paste it in this website.**

The pasted images are processed and downloaded locally in your device. \
No data is ever sent.

*This is an open source project, check out the [source code](https://github.com/AlejandroAkbal/Paste-Image-to-Download).*
