[Paste Image to Download](/) is a utility website made by [Alejandro Akbal](https://akbal.dev)
for downloading images in your clipboard.

This tool was made for those moments where you take a screenshot and it is directly copied to the clipboard. \
Instead of going to MS Paint and pasting the image, saving it and choosing a location... You can just paste it here.

The pasted images are processed and downloaded locally. \
No data ever gets out of your device.

This is an open source project, check out the [source code](https://github.com/AlejandroAkbal/Paste-Image-to-Download).
